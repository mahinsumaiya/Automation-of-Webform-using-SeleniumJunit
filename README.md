# Automation Using JUnit

## Project Overview

##### Here, 2 webforms have been automated using automation tool(Selenium) & framework(JUnit); namely:

###### 1)Practice webform for learners(https://www.digitalunite.com/practice-webform-learners)

###### 2)Guest Registration Form(https://demo.wpeverest.com/user-registration/guest-registration-form/)



## The steps I have considered for these two webforms are:

### Steps for First Webform(Practice webform for learners) Automation:

1. Input all the fields. During the web form submission process, upload any file (2mb limit);

2. Then click on submit button;
 
3. After successful submission, assert the expected message as: Thank you for your submission!

### Steps for Second Webform(Guest Registration Form) Automation:

1. Input following fields: Firstname, Lastname, UserEmail, Gender, Date of Birth, Nationality, Phone, Country(Bangladesh), Terms & Conditions
  
2. Then click on submit button
   
3. Finally, Assert that registration is successful
